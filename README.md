# JurySelection

In this repo, I recreate the incredible analyses done by the team of the podcast [In The Dark](https://www.apmreports.org/in-the-dark). I came to the same conclusions: that Black jurors were disproportionately struck by the prosecution in Mississippi. 

The Supreme Court agreed. You can read their opinion [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-9572_k536.pdf).

Their data can be found on their [GitHub](https://github.com/APM-Reports/jury-data)
